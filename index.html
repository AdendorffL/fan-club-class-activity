          <h1>Campaign</h1>
          <p>
            The year is 2016, and despite the efforts of the United States
            Marine Corps and the Special Air Service, the Ultranationalists
            seize control of Russia and declare Imran Zakhaev a hero and martyr,
            erecting a statue of him in the heart of the Red Square.
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of Zakhaev's former lieutenants,
            begins a campaign against Europe by committing brutal acts of
            terrorism over the course of five years. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army
            Ranger PFC Joseph Allen assists his commanding officer Sgt. Foley in
            training the local soldiers until he is called to run a training
            course overseen by Lieutenant General Shepherd, who is recruiting
            one of the Rangers for a special operation. After completing the
            course, Allen and the rest of the 75th Ranger Regiment assists in
            the taking of a city from local OpFor soldiers. Impressed by Allen's
            abilities, General Shepherd recruits him into "Task Force 141", an
            elite, multi-national counter-terrorist unit under Shepherd's
            command.

            Meanwhile, two other members of 141, Cpt. 'Soap' MacTavish and Sgt.
            Gary 'Roach' Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan
            mountains to retrieve an ACS (Attack Characterization System) module
            from a downed satellite. During their infiltration, Soap orders
            Roach to plant explosives to cover their escape, but is compromised
            while retrieving the ACS. While they are pursued by enemy forces,
            both men manage to escape with the module.

      <p>
        <strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</strong> features three main game
        modes, each offering a unique way to experience the action. The
        <strong>Campaign</strong> delivers a gripping, story-driven experience
        where players join Task Force 141 alongside legendary characters like
        <em>Soap</em>, <em>Ghost</em>, and <em>Captain Price</em> on missions
        that span the globe. The <strong>Multiplayer</strong> mode brings
        fast-paced competitive gameplay with iconic maps such as <em>Rust</em>,
        <em>Terminal</em>, and <em>Highrise</em>, alongside classic modes like
        Team Deathmatch, Search &amp; Destroy, and Domination. Finally,
        <strong>Special Ops (Spec Ops)</strong> offers cooperative missions
        designed to test players’ teamwork and tactical skills, ranging from
        stealth infiltrations to large-scale battles. Together, these modes make
        MW2 one of the most complete and unforgettable Call of Duty experiences.
