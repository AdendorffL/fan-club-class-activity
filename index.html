        <h1>Campaign</h1>
        <p>
	    The year is 2016, and despite the efforts of the United States Marine Corps and 
            the Special Air Service, the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and 
            declare Imran Zakhaev a hero and martyr, erecting a statue of him in the heart 
            of the Red Square.
	<p> 
	<p>
	    Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of Zakhaev's former lieutenants, 
            begins a campaign against Europe by committing brutal acts of terrorism over the 
            course of five years. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army Ranger PFC Joseph Allen assists his 
            commanding officer Sgt. Foley in training the local soldiers until he is called to run 
            a training course overseen by Lieutenant General Shepherd, who is recruiting one of the 
            Rangers for a special operation. After completing the course, Allen and the rest of the 
            75th Ranger Regiment assists in the taking of a city from local OpFor soldiers. Impressed 
            by Allen's abilities, General Shepherd recruits him into "Task Force 141", an elite, 
            multi-national counter-terrorist unit under Shepherd's command. 
	    
	 <p>
	    Meanwhile, two other members of 141, Cpt. 'Soap' MacTavish and Sgt. Gary 'Roach' Sanderson 
	    infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to retrieve an ACS (Attack Characterization System) 
	    module from a downed satellite. During their infiltration, Soap orders Roach to plant explosives to 
	    cover their escape, but is compromised while retrieving the ACS. While they are pursued by enemy forces, both 
	    men manage to escape with the module.
